# YHK-Cat-Thermal-Printer

Mini **cat/rabbit** **thermal** printer of the **YHK** type

This is yet another project with a **Cat/Rabbit thermal printer**. Other GitHub sources are also accessible, however none of them were successful for me because they all used the Cat-Printer with BLE protocol.

Unfortunately, my cat-printer uses a different firmware version that is based on the Classic bluetooth protocol rather than the GATT based protocol. **YHK-XXXX** was broadcast by my printer. The last four characters of the printer's **MAC address** are XXXX.

The Android and iOS app named **WalkPrint** is compatible with my cat printer. Although the app is worthless, some features need logging in.

My starting point: I was motivated from [This blogpost](https://werwolv.net/blog/cat_printerhttps:/) and planned to have my own printer. I did spent some time working on the [bitbank2/Thermal_Printer](https://github.com/bitbank2/Thermal_Printer) project, but I soon found that since my printer¬†is different so no other code will run on it.

### Some real work of RE üöÄÔ∏è

In order to obtain certain internals, I have started my own reverse engineering.

To examine the packet exchange between the phone and the printer, I decompiled the Android app, grabbed the BT snoop log from my phone, and then opened the log file in WireShark. And indeed, the BLE/GATT-based system was not the cause. Decompiled code for Android supports that.

### Action Replay üòÑ

Therefore, everything is straightforward. I attempted to send the same commands and data packets from my dependable Raspberry Pi Zero W through RFCOMM on the terminal based on the WirteShark logs. I finally succeeded in printing the identical image that was on my phone after a few failed attempts. In action replaySo things are simple. Based on the WirteShark logs, I tried to send the same commands/data paylods from my trusty **Raspberry pi Zero W** via **RFCOMM** on terminal. After few trial, I was able to print the same image as it was from my phone.

### The Final Result üëÄÔ∏è

To make this functional, the next task was to produce the data payload from my script. I went back and pulled three routines from the decompiled code to capture the BITMAP, transform it to 1 Bit pictures, and append some bytes as file headers. This step was more difficult because I was only able to obtain the function name. I then tried writing the similler routines in some other Python code, and it succeeded.


### How to use the script? üéâÔ∏è

1. Scan the MAC address of your printer using Bluetoothctl
2. Run scan on if printer found run pair xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx ADDR and trust xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
3. Exit bluetoothctl
4. Run sdptool add --channel=N SP, where **"N"** is the channel, remember this as you will need this in the script. I have selected 2 in my case.
5. Run sudo rfcomm bind **N** xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx, N  = channel = port
6. Run cat-printer.py
